Putting together some quick explanations for how we'll handle this application.

We're going to use Flask for our framework, with Python 2.7. For the DBMS, we will use PostgreSQL.

When you install this package, you will need to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to get all of your python packages.

Initially, we'll put together the pages we need, and correct routing.

Next, we'll add page functionality like buttons, taskbars, and events.

Finally, we'll add the database and related functionality.

We'll add a requirement.txt document once we have specific software versions, as well as suggested installation instructions. It's recommended you do development in a virtual environment to manage your Python package versions.
