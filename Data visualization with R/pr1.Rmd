_Note: This project involves getting data ready for analysis and doing some preliminary investigations. Project 2 will involve modeling and predictions on the same dataset, and will be released at a later date. Both projects will have equal weightage towards your grade. You may reuse some of the preprocessing/analysis steps from Project 1 in Project 2._

# Data

In this project, you will explore a dataset that contains information about movies, including ratings, budget, gross revenue and other attributes. It was prepared by Dr. Guy Lebanon, and here is his description of the dataset:

> The file [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) contains a dataframe with the same name that has 40K rows and 39 columns. Each row represents a movie title and each column represents a descriptor such as `Title`, `Actors`, and `Budget`. I collected the data by querying IMDb’s API (see [www.omdbapi.com](http://www.omdbapi.com/)) and joining it with a separate dataset of movie budgets and gross earnings (unknown to you). The join key was the movie title. This data is available for personal use, but IMDb’s terms of service do not allow it to be used for commercial purposes or for creating a competing repository.

# Objective

Your goal is to investigate the relationship between the movie descriptors and the box office success of movies, as represented by the variable `Gross`. This task is extremely important as it can help a studio decide which titles to fund for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release a title, how much to invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information is most useful before a title is released, but it is still very valuable after the movie is already released to the public (for example it can affect additional marketing spend or how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for “second window” streaming rights).

# Instructions

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. Open this file in RStudio to get started.

When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
x = 1:10
print(x^2)
```

Plots appear inline too:
```{r}
plot(x, x^2, 'o')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*. Enter some R code and run it.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

Please complete all the tasks below by implementing code chunks that have a `TODO` comment in them, running all code chunks so that output and plots are displayed, and typing in answers to each question (**Q:** ...) next to/below the corresponding answer prompt (**A:**). Feel free to add code chunks/show additional output to support any of the answers.

When you are done, you will need to submit the final R markdown file (as **pr1.Rmd**) with all code chunks implemented and executed, and all text responses written in. You also need to submit a PDF export of the markdown file (as **pr1.pdf**), which should show your code, output, plots and written responses--this will be your project report. Compress these two files into a single .zip archive and upload it on T-Square.

# Setup

## Load data

Make sure you've downloaded the [`movies_merged`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/gt-cs6242/project/movies_merged) file and it is in the current working directory. Now load it into memory:

```{r}
load('movies_merged')
cat("Dataset has", dim(movies_merged)[1], "rows and", dim(movies_merged)[2], "columns", end="\n", file="")
```

This creates an object of the same name (`movies_merged`). For convenience, you can copy it to `df` and start using it:

```{r}
df = movies_merged
cat("Column names:", end="\n", file="")
colnames(df)
```

## Load R packages

Load any R packages that you will need to use. You can come back to this chunk, edit it and re-run to load any additional packages later.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

If you are loading any non-standard packages (ones that have not been discussed in class or explicitly allowed for this project), please mention them below. Include any special instructions if they cannot be installed using the regular `install.packages('<pkg name>')` command.

**Non-standard packages used**: None

# Tasks

Each task below is worth **10** points, and is meant to be performed sequentially, i.e. do step 2 after you have processed the data as described in step 1. Total points: **100**

Complete each task by implementing code chunks as described by `TODO` comments, and by responding to questions ("**Q**:") with written answers ("**A**:"). If you are unable to find a meaningful or strong relationship in any of the cases when requested, explain why not by referring to appropriate plots/statistics.

It is okay to handle missing values below by omission, but please omit as little as possible. It is worthwhile to invest in reusable and clear code as you may need to use it or modify it in project 2.

## 1. Remove non-movie rows

The variable `Type` captures whether the row is a movie, a TV series, or a game. Remove all rows from `df` that do not correspond to movies.

```{r}
# TODO: Remove all rows from df that do not correspond to movies
df2 <- df[df$Type == "movie",]
dim(df2)
```

**Q**: How many rows are left after removal? _Enter your response below._

**A**:40000 rows are left after removal.

## 2. Process `Runtime` column

The variable `Runtime` represents the length of the title as a string. Write R code to convert it to a numeric value (in minutes) and replace `df$Runtime` with the new numeric column.

```{r}
# TODO: Replace df$Runtime with a numeric column containing the runtime in minutes
Runtime.df <- df2[c(1, 5, 2, 36)]
#prepair the dataframe
Runtime.df[Runtime.df == "N/A"] <- NA
Runtime.df <- Runtime.df[complete.cases(Runtime.df$Runtime),]
#remove the N/A inputs from Runtime column
for (m in seq(1, nrow(Runtime.df), by = 1)) {
  a <- strsplit(Runtime.df$Runtime[m], " ")
  if (length(unlist(a)) == 2)
  {
    Runtime.df$new.Runtime[m] <- as.integer(as.character(a[[1]][1]))
  }
  if (length(unlist(a)) == 4)
  {
    Runtime.df$new.Runtime[m] <- as.integer(as.character(a[[1]][1])) * 60 +
      as.integer(as.character(a[[1]][3]))
  }
  m = m + 1
}
#convert each splited string element of Runtime column to integer for each row 
#put the new integer Runtime value into a new column
```

Now investigate the distribution of `Runtime` values and how it changes over years (variable `Year`, which you can bucket into decades) and in relation to the budget (variable `Budget`). Include any plots that illustrate.

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate the distribution of Runtime values and how it varies by Year and Budget
Runtime.sample <- Runtime.df[sample(nrow(Runtime.df), 3000),]
#generate a sample dataframe with randomly selected 3000 rows
aa<- ggplot(Runtime.sample, aes(x=Year, y= new.Runtime, colour = Budget)) +
     geom_point(size = 1, shape = 19) + geom_smooth(se=F, method = 'gam')
#make a point plot for Runtime as year changes, facet marks the different Budgets
print(aa)
bb<- ggplot(Runtime.df, aes(x=new.Runtime, y= Budget, na.rm=TRUE)) +
     geom_smooth(span= 0.02, se=F)
#make a point plot for Runtime as Budget changes
print(bb)
```

_Feel free to insert additional code chunks as necessary._

**Q**: Comment on the distribution as well as relationships. Are there any patterns or trends that you can observe?

**A**: From the scatter_point plots about year VS runtime, we can see that at the beginning year around 1890, movies are very short. It may be due to the technique difficulties to produce long movies. As the technology improved from year to year, long movies have been made around 1920. From that time, there are two types of length of movie: one is short movies, which are less than 30 minutes; another is long movies, which are longer than an hour. 
The bar graph show the relationship between Runtime and Budget. Either the very short movies or the very long movies have relatively low budgets. The movies, which have pretty high budgets, mostly run about 90 minutes to 120 minutes. 

## 3. Encode `Genre` column

The column `Genre` represents a list of genres associated with the movie in a string format. Write code to parse each text string into a binary vector with 1s representing the presence of a genre and 0s the absence, and add it to the dataframe as additional columns. Then remove the original `Genre` column.

For example, if there are a total of 3 genres: Drama, Comedy, and Action, a movie that is both Action and Comedy should be represented by a binary vector <0, 1, 1>. Note that you need to first compile a dictionary of all possible genres and then figure out which movie has which genres (you can use the R `tm` package to create the dictionary).

```{r}
# TODO: Replace Genre with a collection of binary columns
df3<-df2[c(1, 6, 5, 38)]
#prepair the dataframe to remive the missing velue of Genre column
df3[df3 == "N/A"] <- NA
df3 <- df3[complete.cases(df3$Genre),]
d <- strsplit(df3$Genre, ", ")
#split the elements of Genre column based on ", "
level.genre <- unique(unlist(d))
#get the list of total different genres of movie
print(level.genre)
print(length(level.genre))
for (m in seq(1, nrow(df3), by = 1)) {
  df3$newGenre[[m]] <- 1* level.genre %in% unlist(d[m])
  m = m + 1
}
#match each row of Genre column with level.genre, show the matching as 1
#put the binary results into the new column newGenre
```

Plot the relative proportions of movies having the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Select movies from top 10 most common genres and plot their relative proportions
count.genre <- data.frame(level.genre, h = rep(0, times = 28))
#create a dataframe with first column as level.genre 
#and second column as 28 integers with default value o
library("plyr")
b <- ldply(df3$newGenre)
#split the newGenre column elements and put them into a new dataframe
for (m in seq(1, length(level.genre), by = 1)) {
   count.genre$h[m] <- count(b[, m], var = 1)[[2]][2]
}
#count how many "1" presence based on each level.genre element
#put each count into the second column of dataframe orderly
ordered.count.genre <- count.genre[order(count.genre$h), ]
#order the table based on the counted results in column h
q<- ordered.count.genre$level.genre[19:28]
#get the top 10 common movie genre
print(q)
for(m in seq(28, 19, by= -1)){
  ordered.count.genre$g[m] <- ordered.count.genre$h[m]/nrow(df3)
  m = m -1
}
#compute the relative proportion of each top 10 common movie genre 
#and put them into new column g orderly
r <- ordered.count.genre$g[19:28]
myData <- data.frame(q, r)
#prepair the dataframe to plot
cc <-
  ggplot(myData, aes(x = reorder(q,-r), y = r)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("top 10 common movie genre") + 
  ylab("relative propotions")
#make a bar graph to show the relative proportions of 10 top common movie genres
print(cc)
```

Examine how the distribution of `Runtime` changes across genres for the top 10 most common genres.

```{r}
# TODO: Plot Runtime distribution for top 10 most common genres
Genre.df3 <- df3[c(1, 3, 4)]
Genre.df3 <- na.omit(Genre.df3)
#prepair the dataframe and remove the missing inputs
for (m in seq(1, nrow(Genre.df3), by = 1)) {
  a <- strsplit(Genre.df3$Runtime[m], " ")
  if (length(unlist(a)) == 2)
  {
    Genre.df3$new.Runtime[m] <- as.integer(as.character(a[[1]][1]))
  }
  if (length(unlist(a)) == 4)
  {
    Genre.df3$new.Runtime[m] <- as.integer(as.character(a[[1]][1])) * 60 +
      as.integer(as.character(a[[1]][3]))
  }
  m = m + 1
}
#convert the Runtime column to a numeric new.Runtime column
a <- 1*level.genre %in% q
#match the levels of genre and the top 10 genres to have a binary vector
b1 <- Genre.df3$new.Runtime * b
q2 <- rep(0, time = 28)
for(m in seq(1, 28, by = 1)){
  q2[m] <- mean(b1[ ,m], na.rm = TRUE)
  m = m + 1
}
q3 <- q2 * a
q4 = rep(0, time=10)
n=1
for(m in seq(1, length(q3), by = 1)){
  if(q3[m]>0){
    q4[n]<-q3[m]
    n = n + 1
  }
  m = m + 1
}
print(q4)
myData <-data.frame(q,q4)
dd <-
  ggplot(myData, aes(x = reorder(q, -q4), y = q4)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("top 10 common movie genre") + 
  ylab("Runtime mean")
print(dd)
```

**Q**: Describe the interesting relationship(s) you observe. Are there any expected or unexpected trends that are evident?

**A**: From the bar graph showed above, I can see that some types of movies are likely to have a longer runtime than the other types of movies. Among the top 10 common movie genres, crime movies and action movies are likely to have the longer runtime. The length of these two types are much longer than the rest 8 types of movies. It means that these 2 types of movies generally need more time to tell a whole story.

## 4. Eliminate mismatched rows

The dataframe was put together by merging two different sources of data and it is possible that the merging process was inaccurate in some cases (the merge was done based on movie title, but there are cases of different movies with the same title). There are 3 columns that contain date information: `Year` (numeric year), `Date` (numeric year), and `Released` (string representation of the release date).

Find and remove all rows where you suspect a merge error occurred based on a mismatch between these variables. To make sure subsequent analysis and modeling work well, avoid removing more than 10% of the rows that have a `Gross` value present.

_Note: Do not remove the rows with `Gross == NA` at this point, just use this a guideline._

```{r}
# TODO: Remove rows with Year/Date/Released mismatch
V1 <- df2$Title
V2 <- df2$Year
V3 <- df2$Released
V4 <- df2$Date
V5 <- df2$Gross
df4 <- data.frame(V1, V2, V3, V4, V5)
colnames(df4) <- c("Title", "Year", "Released", "Date", "Gross")
nrow(df4)
count.delete = 0
for (m in seq(1, nrow(df4), by = 1)) {
  if (!is.na(df4$Date[m]) && !is.na(df4$Year[m])) {
    if (df4$Date[m] != df4$Year[m])
    {
      df4 <- df4[-c(m),]
      count.delete = count.delete + 1
    }
  }
  m = m + 1
}
#check the mismatch based on Year and Date columns
#print out many rows left and how many rows deleted
print(count.delete)
nrow(df4)
for (m in seq(1, nrow(df4), by = 1)) {
  if (!is.na(df4$Released[m]) && !is.na(df4$Year[m])) {
    cc <- as.integer(format(df4$Released[m], "%Y"))
    if (cc != df4$Year[m])
    {
      df4 <- df4[-c(m),]
      count.delete = count.delete + 1
    }
  }
  m = m + 1
}
#check the mismatch based on Year and Released columns
#print out many rows left and how many rows deleted
print(count.delete)
nrow(df4)
```

**Q**: What is your precise removal logic, and how many rows remain in the resulting dataset?

**A**: There are 34798 rows left and 5202 rows have been found with mismatch. I compared Year column VS Date column directly because both are YYYY year format. And I compared Year VS Released column by convert released date format YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY. If any pairs of comparision does not match, it means that the mismatch happened when files combination. Then the mismatch row is deleted. count.delete is used to count how many row has been deleted during the comparision. 

## 5. Explore `Gross` revenue

For the commercial success of a movie, production houses want to maximize Gross revenue. Investigate if Gross revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre in any way.

_Note: To get a meaningful relationship, you may have to partition the movies into subsets such as short vs. long duration, or by genre, etc._

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Budget, Runtime or Genre
df5 <- df2[complete.cases(df2$Gross),]
df5 <- df5[c(1, 4, 5, 6, 36, 38)]
#prepair the dataframe for this question including the necessary columns
for(m in seq(1, nrow(df5), by =1)){
  b <- strsplit(df5$Runtime[m]," ")
  if (length(unlist(b)) == 2)
  {
    df5$new.Runtime[m] <- as.integer(as.character(b[[1]][1]))
  }
  if (length(unlist(b)) == 4)
  {
    df5$new.Runtime[m] <- as.integer(as.character(b[[1]][1])) * 60 +
      as.integer(as.character(b[[1]][3]))
  }
  m = m + 1
}
#split the character Runtime column to a new numeric new.runtime column
runtime.df5 <- df5[complete.cases(df5$new.Runtime),]
#remove the missing inputs row of Runtime column for plot
ee<-ggplot(runtime.df5, aes(x = new.Runtime, y = Gross )) + 
            geom_point(stat = "identity") + 
            xlab("Runtime") + 
            ylab("Gross")
#point plot to illustrate the relationship between Gross and Runtime
print(ee)
ff <- ggplot(df5, aes(x = Budget, y = Gross)) +
      geom_point(stat = "identity") + geom_smooth(se=F) +
      xlab("Budget") + ylab("Gross")
#point plot to illustrate the relationship between Gross and Budget
print(ff)
Genre.Gross.data <- cbind(df3$Gross, b1)
colnames(Genre.Gross.data) <- c("Gross", level.genre)
Genre.Gross.data <- Genre.Gross.data[complete.cases(Genre.Gross.data$Gross),]
#prepair the dataframe with Gross column and remove the missing Gross input rows
for(m in seq(2, ncol(Genre.Gross.data), by = 1)){
  Genre.Gross.data[m] <- Genre.Gross.data$Gross * Genre.Gross.data[m]
  m = m + 1
}
#apply Gross value to each type of movie genre
k=rep(0,time=28)
for(m in seq(2,29,by=1)){
  k[m-1] <- mean(Genre.Gross.data[ ,m][Genre.Gross.data[ ,m]>0])
  m = m+1
}
#compute the mean of Gross for each type of movie genre
GGData <- data.frame(level.genre,k)
GGData <- na.omit(GGData)
#prepair the dataframe to plot and remove the missing value rows
gg <- ggplot(GGData, aes(x=reorder(level.genre, -k), y=k)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      coord_flip() + xlab("Genre") + ylab("Gross")
#bar plot to illustrate the distribution of Gross for different type of genres
print(gg)
```

**Q**: Did you find any observable relationships or combinations of Budget/Runtime/Genre that result in high Gross revenue? If you divided the movies into different subsets, you may get different answers for them - point out interesting ones.

**A**: As three plots showed above, I plotted a scatter_point graph to illustrate the relationship bentween Gross and Runtime. I can see that the middle length movie, which are about 90 mins to 120 mins, generate more gross revenue than short and long movies. It makes sense in real, since most of popular movies fall into there timeframe as we normally watch in theaters. 
The second scatter_point plot with smooth line illustrate that gross and budget have a positive relationship. As budget increased, the gross revenue increased. The extreme point showed at the right top of plot is a movie with the highest budget and generate the most gross revenue. 
From the third bar plot I can see that some types of movie are likely generate more gross revenue than the other types of movie. Movies in animation genre geneate the most gross revenue than the rest of genres. Kids love animation movies. Animation movies are great choices as family movies. 

```{r}
# TODO: Investigate if Gross Revenue is related to Release Month
df5 <- movies_merged[complete.cases(movies_merged$Gross),]
df5 <- df5[c(1,4,5,6,36,38)]
#prepair for the dataframe as needed
df5$Released <- as.integer(format(df5$Released, "%m"))
#convert the released date to month
df5 <- df5[complete.cases(df5$Released),]
#remove the missing value rows
hh <- ggplot(df5, aes(x=factor(Released), y=Gross)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
      xlab("Released Month") +
      ylab("Gross")
#bar graph to illustrate the Gross for each 12 month
#from the bar plot showed below I can clearly see two seasons generate more gross revenue than the rest of year. It makes sense in real, because they are the summer break and winter break. Students have more chance to watch movies during the breaks.
print(hh)
```

## 6. Process `Awards` column

The variable `Awards` describes nominations and awards in text format. Convert it to 2 numeric columns, the first capturing the number of wins, and the second capturing nominations. Replace the `Awards` column with these new columns, and then study the relationship of `Gross` revenue with respect to them.

_Note: The format of the `Awards` column is not standard; you may have to use regular expressions to find the relevant values. Try your best to process them, and you may leave the ones that don't have enough information as NAs or set them to 0s._

```{r}
# TODO: Convert Awards to 2 numeric columns: wins and nominations
install.packages('stringr')
library(stringr)
library(stringi)

df6<- df2[c(1, 12, 13, 38, 16, 17, 22, 28)]
#prepair the dataframe for this question
df6[df6 == "N/A"] <-NA
#replace N/A with NA
Awards.df6 <- df6[complete.cases(df6$Awards),]
#remove the N/A inputs for Awards column
winOnly <- str_extract(Awards.df6$Awards,"(^[0-9]+) wins*\\.")
Awards.df6$Wins <- as.numeric(str_extract_all(winOnly, "[0-9]+"))
#case 1 - for wins only - extract numbers and put them into Wins column
nominOnly <- str_extract(Awards.df6$Awards,"(^[0-9]+) nomination.*")
Awards.df6$Nominations <- as.numeric(str_extract_all(nominOnly, "[0-9]+"))
#case 2 - nominations only - extract numbers and put them into Nominations column
winAndNomin <- str_extract(Awards.df6$Awards, "(^[0-9]+) win.* & [0-9]+ nomination.*")
winAndNomin_extracted <- str_extract_all(winAndNomin, "[0-9]+")
for(m in seq(1, nrow(Awards.df6), by=1)){
  if(!is.na(winAndNomin_extracted[[m]])){
    Awards.df6$Wins[m] <- as.numeric(winAndNomin_extracted[[m]][1])
    Awards.df6$Nominations[m] <- as.numeric(winAndNomin_extracted[[m]][2])
  }
  m = m+1
}
#case 3 - wins and nominations - extract numbers 
#put them into Wins and Nominations columns correspondingly
xx = str_extract(Awards.df6$Awards, ".*Another.*")
#case 4 - for special honors awards
comb_extracted <- str_extract_all(xx, "[0-9]+")
for(m in seq(1, nrow(Awards.df6), by = 1)) {
  z <- stri_extract_all(xx[m], regex = "\\d+", simplify = TRUE)
  #extract numbers from string. length(z) may be 3, 2, or 1
  p <- str_count(xx[m], fixed("omina"))
  #count nomination or nominated. p may be 2, 1 or 0
  if (length(z) == 3) {
    if (p == 2) {
      Awards.df6$Wins[m] <- as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][2])
      Awards.df6$Nominations[m] <-
          as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][1]) + as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][3])
    }
    else{
      Awards.df6$Wins[m] <-
          as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][1]) + as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][2])
      Awards.df6$Nominations[m] <- as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][3])
    }
  }
  if (length(z) == 2) {
    if (p == 2) {
      Awards.df6$Nominations[m] <-
          as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][1]) + as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][2])
    }
    else if (p == 1) {
      if (grepl("win", xx[m])) {
        Awards.df6$Wins[m] <- as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][2])
        Awards.df6$Nominations[m] <- as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][1])
      }
      else{
        Awards.df6$Wins[m] <- as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][1])
        Awards.df6$Nominations[m] <- as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][2])
      }
    }
    else{
    Awards.df6$Wins[m] <-
      as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][1]) + as.numeric(comb_extracted[[m]][2])
    }
  }
  m = m + 1
}
#case 4 for special nominated awards
Awards.df6$Wins <- as.numeric(Awards.df6$Wins)
#convert the Wins column to numeric
length(Awards.df6$Wins)
count.Wins <- na.omit(Awards.df6$Wins)
length(count.Wins)
Awards.df6$Nominations <- as.numeric(Awards.df6$Nominations)
#convert the Nominations column to numeric
length(Awards.df6$Nominations)
count.Nominations <- na.omit(Awards.df6$Nominations)
length(count.Nominations)
```

**Q**: How did you construct your conversion mechanism? How many rows had valid/non-zero wins or nominations?

**A**: There are 10946 Wins and 11418 Nominations as results.
To convert all Awards elements to number of wins and number of nominations, I seperated into 4 cases by using different regular expression patterns: 
case 1: extract number X from "X wins" strings and put X into new Wins column.
case 2: extract number Y from "Y nominations" strings and put Y into new Nominations column
case 3: extract number X and Y from "X wins & Y nominations" strings and put X and Y into new Wins and Nominations columns correspondingly.
case 4: extract numbers from the rest of complicated strings. In this case, I use "z" to count how many numbers extracted from the string and "p" to count how many "omina" words in each string. "omina" represents "Nominated" or "nominations". I also use "win" to seperate the case "Won X ... and Y nominations" and "Nominated Y... and X wins". By setting these three criterions, I can seperate all results with number of wins or won and number of nominations or nominated. For each cases, I put sum of X into new Wins column and sum of Y into Nominations column.

```{r}
# TODO: Plot Gross revenue against wins and nominations
Gross.Awards.df6 <- Awards.df6[complete.cases(Awards.df6$Gross),]
#remove the missing value of Gross to prepair dataframe to plot
myData3 <- Gross.Awards.df6[c(1, 4, 9)]
myData3 <- na.omit(myData3)
ii <- ggplot(myData3, aes(x=Wins, y=Gross)) + geom_point()
print(ii)
myData4 <- Gross.Awards.df6[c(1, 4, 10)]
myData4 <- na.omit(myData4)
jj <- ggplot(myData4, aes(x=Nominations, y=Gross)) + geom_point()
print(jj)
```

**Q**: How does the gross revenue vary by number of awards won and nominations received?

**A**: The two scatter points plots above show the similar positive relationship between wins vs gross and nominations vs gross. The more awards the movies earned, the more gross revenue they generated. That makes sense in real, because people would like to watch the movies which are popular and earned big awards. 

## 7. Movie ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes

There are several variables that describe ratings, including IMDb ratings (`imdbRating` represents average user ratings and `imdbVotes` represents the number of user ratings), and multiple Rotten Tomatoes ratings (represented by several variables pre-fixed by `tomato`). Read up on such ratings on the web (for example [rottentomatoes.com/about](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about) and [ www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq](http:// www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq)).

Investigate the pairwise relationships between these different descriptors using graphs.

```{r}
# TODO: Illustrate how ratings from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes are related
library(GGally)
df7 <- df2[c(1, 16, 17, 22, 28)]
#prepair the dataframe wtih rating columns
df7 <- na.omit(df7)
#remove the missing value rows for either ratings
nrow(df7)
kk<- ggpairs(df7,
        columns = c("imdbRating", "imdbVotes", "tomatoRating", "tomatoUserRating"))
#ggpairs plot to illustrate the relationships among 4 ratings
print(kk)
zz <- ggplot(df7, aes(x=tomatoRating, y=imdbVotes)) + geom_point()
#Scatter-point plot to illustrate the relationship beteween two ratings
print(zz)
```

**Q**: Comment on the similarities and differences between the user ratings of IMDb and the critics ratings of Rotten Tomatoes.

**A**: From the pairwide plots above I can see both Tomota rating and Tomato user rating consistently correlated with imdb rating and correlated with each other. Imdb rating is highly related with both Tomato ratings too. However, imdb user rating is not tightly related with the rest three ratings. The correlation with Tomato rating and Tomato user rating are 0.217 and 0.234 respectively. 

## 8. Ratings and awards

These ratings typically reflect the general appeal of the movie to the public or gather opinions from a larger body of critics. Whereas awards are given by professional societies that may evaluate a movie on specific attributes, such as artistic performance, screenplay, sound design, etc.

Study the relationship between ratings and awards using graphs (awards here refers to wins and/or nominations). 

```{r}
# TODO: Show how ratings and awards are related
myData5 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 5, 9)]
myData5 <- na.omit(myData5)
ll <- ggplot(myData5, aes(x=imdbRating, y=Wins)) + geom_point() 
print(ll)
myData6 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 5, 10)]
myData6 <- na.omit(myData6)
mm <- ggplot(myData6, aes(x=imdbRating, y=Nominations)) + geom_point()
print(mm)
myData7 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 6, 9)]
myData7 <- na.omit(myData7)
nn <- ggplot(myData7, aes(x=imdbVotes, y=Wins)) + geom_point() 
print(nn)
myData8 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 6, 10)]
myData8 <- na.omit(myData8)
oo <- ggplot(myData8, aes(x=imdbVotes, y=Nominations)) + geom_point()
print(oo)
myData9 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 7, 9)]
myData9 <- na.omit(myData9)
pp <- ggplot(myData9, aes(x=tomatoRating, y=Wins)) + geom_point()
print(pp)
myData10 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 7, 10)]
myData10 <- na.omit(myData10)
qq <- ggplot(myData10, aes(x=tomatoRating, y=Nominations)) + geom_point()
print(qq)
myData11 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 8, 9)]
myData11 <- na.omit(myData11)
rr <- ggplot(myData11, aes(x=tomatoUserRating, y=Wins)) + geom_point()
print(rr)
myData12 <- Awards.df6[c(1, 8, 10)]
myData12 <- na.omit(myData12)
ss <- ggplot(myData12, aes(x=tomatoUserRating, y=Nominations)) + geom_point()
print(ss)
```

**Q**: How good are these ratings in terms of predicting the success of a movie in winning awards or nominations? Is there a high correlation between two variables?

**A**: I studied four different ratings: imdbRating, imdbVotes, tomatoRating and tomatoUserRating. From the graphs above I can conclude that all three ratings, except imdbVotes, have high correlation with both wins and nominations and can predict the awards. Except for some highly rated movies, such as rating close to 10, the higher ratings, the more awards. That means the public and the professional have the similiar evaluation to the movies. Those highly ratings may be got from a small group of fans, which can not reflect the general information as whole. However, imdbVotes has low correlation with awards and can not predict the awards.

## 9. Expected insights

Come up with two new insights (backed up by data and graphs) that is expected. Here “new” means insights that are not an immediate consequence of one of the above tasks. You may use any of the columns already explored above or a different one in the dataset, such as `Title`, `Actors`, etc.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate two expected insights
#insight1 - study for Budget and Gross
df9 <- movies_merged[c(1,36,38)]
df9 <- na.omit(df9)
tt <- ggplot(df9, aes(x=Budget, y=Gross)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F)
print(tt)
#insight2 - study for Domestic Gross and Gross
insight2.df9 <- movies_merged[c(1, 37, 38)]
insight2.df9 <- na.omit(insight2.df9)
uu <- ggplot(insight2.df9, aes(x=Domestic_Gross, y=Gross)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=F)
print(uu)
```

**Q**: Expected insight #1.

**A**: For this insight, I try to illustrate the relationship between Budget and Gross. From the plot above, it clearly shows a linear relationship between budget and gross as I expected. This means that the bigger budget the movie has, the more gross it will gain. It makes sense in real. If the movie has a big budget, the company can hire the famous director and actors. As consequence, the good reputation of director and actors will attract more customers to watch the movie to make more profit for the company. 


**Q**: Expected insight #2.

**A**: for this insight, I try to illustrate the relationship between domestic gross and gross. From the plot above, it clearly shows a linear relationship between domestic gross and gross as I expected. This means that the movie gain more in domestic market will gain more in international market too. It makes sense in real. The public customers have similar judgement in general. Moreover, it is likely to import the popular and successful movies from outside of the country, which have already make a profit in their original country.


## 10. Unexpected insight

Come up with one new insight (backed up by data and graphs) that is unexpected at first glance and do your best to motivate it. Same instructions apply as the previous task.

```{r}
# TODO: Find and illustrate one unexpected insight
df10 <- movies_merged[c(1, 6, 12, 33, 38)]
df10[df10 == "N/A"] <- NA
df10 <- na.omit(df10)
#remove N/A inputs
df10 <- df10[order(-df10[, 5]),]
#sort the dataframe based on Gross
Gross.prod.df10 <- aggregate(df10$Gross, by=list(Production=df10$Production), FUN=sum)
#sum the Gross by Production
Gross.prod.df10 <- Gross.prod.df10[order(-Gross.prod.df10[,2]),]
#sort the dataframe by Gross
top10.df10 <- head(Gross.prod.df10, 10)
vv <- ggplotpr1(top10.df10, aes(x=reorder(Production, -x), y=x)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
#bar plot to show Gross for top 10 productions
print(vv)
#total number of productions
length(unique(df10$Production))
#top 10 Gross movies with genre, country and production
print(head(df10[c(1,2,3,4)],10))
# top 10 Gross production
print(head(Gross.prod.df10,10))
```

**Q**: Unexpected insight.

**A**: I try to find the top 10 gross movies and production in this dataframe. As showed above, the top 10 gross movies are all the very popular ones, which I have seen. The top 10 productions with the most profit are also the famous movie companies. It's interesting that all top 10 movies are made by USA or partly made by USA. Undoubtedly, USA is powerful in worldwide movie market.
